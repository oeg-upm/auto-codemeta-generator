# Codemeta Generator

Firts at all, This repository is an OEG (Ontology Engineering Group) development built upon the original Codemeta Generator.

This repository contains a (client-side) web application to generate
CodeMeta documents (aka. `codemeta.json`).

The [CodeMeta initiative](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta) is a Free and Open Source academic collaboration
creating a minimal metadata schema for research software and code.

The academic community recommends on adding a codemeta.json file in
the root directory of your repository.

With this linked data metadata file, you can easily declare the authorship,
include contextual information and link to other research outputs (publications,
data, etc.).

Also, the `codemeta.json` file in your source code is indexed in the
Software Heritage (SWH) archive, which will improve findability in searches.

## Specifications

### Use case

1. create a complete codemeta.json file from scratch
2. aggregate existing information and add complementary information to
   a codemeta.json file

### Functionalities

- helpers while completing the form, for example a reference list of spdx
  licenses
- a validation mechanism after submission
- the possibility to use all the codeMeta terms and schema.org terms
- accessible from multiple platforms (web browsers or OS)
- (extra) the possibility to correct the output after validation as part
  of the creation process

This tool was initially prepared for the [FORCE19 Hackathon](https://github.com/force11/force11-rda-scidwg/tree/master/hackathon/FORCE2019).

**NB:** codemeta v2.0 is generated by default, but v3.0 (v2.0 compatible) can be generated via a dedicated button.

## Code contributions

This section only applies to developers who want to contribute to the Codemeta Generator.
If you only want to use it, you can use
[the hosted version](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/) instead.

### Code guidelines

This application is designed to work on popular modern browsers (Firefox,
Chromium/Google Chrome, Edge, Safari). Check [Caniuse](https://caniuse.com/)
for availability of features for these browsers.

To keep the architecture simple, we serve javascript files directly to
browsers, without a compiler or transpiler.

### Running local changes

To run Codemeta Generator, you just need an HTTP server serving the
files (nginx, apache2, etc.).

The simplest way is probably to use Python's HTTP server:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oeg-upm/auto-codemeta-generator
cd codemeta-generator
python3 -m http.server
```

then open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your web browser.

### Automatic testing

In addition to manual testing, we have automated tests to check for bugs
quickly, using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

To run them, first install Cypress:

```shell
sudo apt install npm  # or the equivalent on your system
npx cypress@9.7.0 install
```

Then, run the tests:

```shell
npx cypress@9.7.0 run
```

The OEGâ€™s new development adds a small configuration file, config.json, which allows setting the default repository to be migrated and the FastAPI service URL.

## Install Autocodemeta Generator in server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oeg-upm/auto-codemeta-generator

cd codemeta-generator
python3 -m http.server 80
```
or 
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
Install service with FAST API to migrate properties from SOMEF
```bash
cd codemeta-generator/server/
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install from Pypi SOMEF, FASTAPI and UVICORN

SOMEF [is available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/). To install it just type (default version is Python 3.10):
(default version is Python 3.10)

```bash
pip install somef fastapi uvicorn
pip show somef fastapi uvicorn
somef --help
```

If everything goes fine, you should see:

```bash
Usage: somef [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  configure  Configure credentials
  describe   Running the Command Line Interface
  version    Show somef version.
```

Configure

Before running SOMEF, you must configure it appropriately. Run:

```bash
python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
python -m nltk.downloader omw-1.4
```
To download two wordnet modules needed. Then run:

```bash
somef configure
```

And you will be asked to provide the following: 

- A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour. For more information, see [https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) 
- The path to the trained classifiers (pickle files). If you have your own classifiers, you can provide them here. Otherwise, you can leave it blank

If you want to configure SOMEF with the default parameters, just type:

```bash
somef configure -a
```

For showing help about the available options, run:

```bash
somef configure --help
```
Which displays:

```bash
Usage: somef configure [OPTIONS]

  Configure GitHub credentials and classifiers file path

Options:
  -a, --auto  Automatically configure SOMEF
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```

RUN FAST API
cd codemeta-generator/server/
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 23705 --log-level debug

CONFIG URL
There is a config.json where it can be change the default repository to migrate and the fast api url

{
    "default_repo": "https://github.com/tpronk/somef-demo-repo",
    "fastapi_url": "https://api.autocodemeta.linkeddata.es"
}
